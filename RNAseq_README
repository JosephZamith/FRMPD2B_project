# RNA-Seq Data Analysis: Macaque vs. Human
## Description

This repository contains a Python Jupyter notebook script 'RNAseq FRMPD2 levels macaqueVShuman_GitHub.ipynb' for analyzing developmental mRNA-seq data from rhesus macaques and humans. 
The data is sourced from the Psychencode portal and is linked to the Sousa et al., 2018 publication.
The script reads an Excel file, specifically `mRNA-seq_QC_RKPM.xlsx`, containing mRNA-seq data of the level of FRMPD2 in RKPM in macaque and human and then groups and processes the data by species and brain region. 
The selected brain regions for this analysis are all cortical regions, specified as `regions=["VFC","MFC","DFC","OFC","M1C","S1C","A1C","V1C","IPC","STC","ITC"]`.
The data are then pooled by every log2 of age starting from \(2^6\) post-conception days.
The analysis involves calculating the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM) for the `F2B` gene based on predicted age, both linearly and in log2 scale. 
Finally, the processed data is saved back to Excel files for further use.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Put your mRNA-seq data file (`mRNA-seq_QC_RKPM.xlsx`) in the project directory.
3. Run the Python script.

The script will generate two Excel files:
- `extracted_RNAseq_macaqueVShuman_RKPM.xlsx`: Contains grouped data based on the predicted age.
- `extracted_RNAseq_macaqueVShuman_log2_RKPM.xlsx`: Contains grouped data based on the log2 of the predicted age, where the mean and SEM have been calculated.
